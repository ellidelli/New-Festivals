# New Festivals Stardew Mod
## What is this?
This is a Stardew Valley mod created for my open-source class. When installed, it will add new festivals to the game. *It is currently in progress so it won't do much at the moment.*

**Currently**: working on adding a trick or treat festival. 
## Dependancies
* [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/)
* [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915)
